Welcome to Ogame Professor.

This app is being developed right now for Abraham Mora aka Kalume.

Feel free to post any issue and ask for features.

----SETUP----

For new devs:
    1.- Clone the repository:
        `mkdir OgameProfessor && cd OgameProfessor`
        `git clone git@github.com:Kalimordkalume/OgameProfessor.git`
    2.- If you already have Poetry install in your system:
        `poetry install`
        If you don't have Poetry installed in your local system and don't want to install it:
        `python3 -m venv .venv`
        `source .venv/bin/activate`
        Install poetry in your virtual env:
        `pip install poetry`
        Now use poetry for managing the repository:
        `poetry install`
    3.- You are good to go.
